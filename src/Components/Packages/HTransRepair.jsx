              Many patients are reluctant to seek a second hair transplant,
              especially a revision hair transplant, due to having endured a
              less than ideal experience the first time. The fear of an unknown
              outcome, or the rehashing of a perceived unpleasant prior hair
              transplant experience, is enough to lead clients to simply shy
              away from a revision hair transplant. Fortunately, with the advent
              of newer techniques, these would-be candidates are more likely to
              benefit from utilizing the latest techniques that make hair
              transplants virtually undetectable.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              This is promising news for those individuals who previously
              underwent a hair transplant using outdated methods such as hair
              plugs or mini/ micro grafts. A corrective procedure using the
              latest techniques such as FUT or FUE will undoubtedly improve the
              appearance of unsightly plugs. In most situations, a revision hair
              transplant can restore a more natural appearance to an otherwise
              unnatural look.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Old Pluggy Hair</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              From its inception, hair transplantation hair plugs ranged in size
              from 2-10 mm. These plugs could move hair from the donor to
              balding areas of the scalp but they were unable to create a
              natural appearing hairline. In the early years, plug surgery
              hairlines were like tufts of isolated hair amid an ocean of scalp
              making transplanted hair quite obvious and unsightly. In the
              ensuing years, plug surgery improved with grafts decreasing in
              size to as small as 1-2 mm. These grafts were called mini grafts
              and micro grafts and were considered a vast improvement over
              plugs. Despite being smaller grafts, the results were still
              detectable.

                </b>
               Plug revision and improvement upon the
              outward appearance of the surrounding scalp can easily be achieved
              with the new FUE methods. By utilizing this method, the two
              problems will be addressed concurrently:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Plugs with 100% density of hair will be thinned out by removing
                some of the hair follicles thereby reducing the density.
              </li>

              <li>
                Surrounding areas with 0% hair will receive the transplanted
                follicular units thus creating a more natural grouping. This
                maneuvering of grafts will give even more density and can
                eliminate the “pluggy” appearance.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Hairline with Large Grafts</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              The typical appearance of a native (non-transplanted) hairline is
              typically comprised of two rows of follicular units consisting of
              one single hair. Between the extraction and placement process,
              hairs are sorted and counted. If this step is skipped, and hairs
              are not properly selected before placement, it is highly likely
              that grafts containing 2 or 3 hairs will be erroneously placed in
              the hairline. This deviation will not result in a natural look.
              This issue is particularly more noticeable if the patient has
              coarse hair.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              The proper method of designing and creating a natural hairline is
              to transplant only grafts with single hair in the very front 0.5
              to 1cm aspect. Singles are followed by grafts with 2 hairs to the
              rear then grafts with 3 and 4 hairs. This natural order will give
              good density and bulk to the more posterior area, and beyond,
              while creating a natural transitional zone in the very front.

                Treatment of hairline with larger grafts –
                </b>
               Successful revision of
              detectable hairlines is not difficult and can be achieved based on
              the original location of the hairline:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                If the hairline was originally placed higher than its natural
                location, creating a natural hairline using only single hair
                grafts is all that is necessary.
              </li>

              <li>
                If the original transplanted hairline was placed too low,
                corrective measures would be necessary to remove any grafts
                having 2 or 3 hairs and replacing them with naturally occurring
                single hair grafts.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="card-text">
              Since a very common miscalculation of early transplants was the
              placement of grafts containing 2 or 3 hairs along the front row of
              the hairline, the presence of multi-hair grafts on the hairline is
              a dead giveaway of an older transplant.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Unnatural hairline design</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Typically, revision procedures are performed on older hair
              transplants. However, newly transplanted hair can appear
              noticeable due to a poor design. In such cases, there is usually a
              mismatch with either an age inappropriate hairline or a total
              disregard for the ethnicity of the patient. Unfortunately,
              hairlines are being designed by inexperienced doctors who overlook
              the relationship of the hairline to the other landmarks of the
              face.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Furthermore, when designing the hairline, there are intentional
              micro and macro irregularities built into the design so that the
              hairline does not have a “connect the dots with a straight line”
              appearance. The following are common occurrences with respect to
              hairline design which may result in an unnatural hairline:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>
                A juvenile hairline –
                </b>
                Research has shown that the average
                non-balding man undergoes maturation of the hairline in most
                ethnicities. Maturation of the hairline is a completely natural
                phenomenon. Thus, recreating a juvenile hairline on an aging man
                is not realistic and expectations of such must be realigned with
                the goal of creating a mature and natural appearing hairline.
              </li>

              <li>
                <b> 
                A linear/straight hairline –
                </b>
                A normal adult hairline should
                possess both macro-irregularity and micro-irregularity. Both
                traits are important in forming a natural looking hairline.
                Regrettably, the surgeon may try to make the hairline too
                perfect while forgetting the importance of these natural
                occurring irregularities during the design of a healthy
                hairline. This is a common mistake often seen in hair
                transplants from inexperienced practitioners. There is an easy
                solution! Simply adding these inherent micro-irregularities is
                an easy fix and does not require a large number of grafts.
              </li>

                Thin hairline –
                </b>
                Inadequate density along the hairline, and just
                beyond, typically results in an outcome that appears unnatural.
                This thinning might be unavoidable in patients who possess fine
                hair from the onset of the process. At this point in time, it is
                inconceivable to restore hair back to its original 100% density
                with only one hair transplant pass. Patients with thick/coarser
                hair are at an advantage in that they can expect to have a more
                solid hairline with only one hair transplant procedure. During
                the hairline planning stage, meticulous attention to detail is
                required to achieve a natural hairline. Consideration to the
                placement of an adequate number of grafts to achieve optimal
                density and in strategic placement of the appropriately sized
                follicular units is necessary.

                Sex inappropriate hairline –
                </b>
                 Hairlines of adult men are
                different than those of their female counterparts. A perfectly
                natural masculine hairline would look completely unnatural and
                harsh for a woman and a feminine hairline would appear odd and
                dainty on a man. The corners on the hairline in adult men are
                usually receded in comparison to the hairline in the midfrontal
                area. A female hairline usually does not present with the
                typical male recession of the corners. In contrast, a feminine
                hairline may be flat or curving downward. A very high hairline
                needs to be lowered through a hairline lowering transplant to
                produce a more attractive frame to the face. On occasion,
                feminine hairlines have slight humps that can redefine and
                minimize the area of the visible forehead.

            </ul>

            <p className="card-text">
              Treatment of an unnatural hairline design can be revised on a case
              by case basis depending upon the presenting hairline. A hairline
              revision to reset to a more natural appearance can easily be
              accomplished in one or two procedures depending on what needs to
              be done. FUE hair transplantations can remove the unwanted hair
              follicles from the hairline and relocate them to a proper position
              elsewhere on the scalp.

            <p className="card-text">
            Scarring left behind by older hair restoration methods can often be seen in either the donor or recipient areas. A widened liner donor scar is typically seen as a result of FUT (follicular unit transplantation) that was performed via an old strip procedure. The revision of old scars can easily be done today using a variety of techniques such as trichophytic closure, FUE into the scar and SMP.

            Incorrect hair orientation
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
            Native scalp hair follows a specific orientation in terms of direction and curvature. Therefore, when follicular unit grafts are placed, the orientation in angulation and curvature must be adhered to in order to achieve natural looking results.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>  Wrong angulation –</b>
               Hair angles follow specific patterns in different areas of the scalp. The angles may change drastically in certain areas along the hairline. The angulation should be monitored and followed in order to create a perfectly natural hairline that is indistinguishable from a natural head of hair. Meticulous attention should be paid to the angle of the exiting native hair during hair design to achieve a completely natural result.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>Wrong curvature –</b>
                 Just like the hair angles, the curvature of each hair differs from area to area on the scalp. Thoughtful vigilance to the curvature of each individual transplanted graft is of particular importance in creating an appearance that looks completely natural. Curvature of the hair shaft is particularly crucial in locations such as the temples, hairlinezand eyebrows. The angles of hair should be planned by a surgical team and revisited throughout the placing phase of the procedure. Upon final inspection, grafts may be rotated
                within their individual sites (if necessary) to adjust according to the natural hair curvature for each area.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b> Treatment of incorrect hair orientation –</b>
                The best treatment for incorrect angulation and curvature of the hair is to prevent them. By using the proper technique during the procedure, a specialist with an artistic flair can easily avoid these problems. However, in the event of encountering such problems, the ill-placed hair follicles should be removed via the FUE method and re-implanted to provide the proper angle and curvature.
