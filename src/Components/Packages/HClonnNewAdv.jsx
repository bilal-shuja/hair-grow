                Is Hair Cloning the future of Hair Restoration?

                <p className="card-text">
                HairAge is always looking into innovations for hair restoration, and cloning might be the next evolution in non-invasive procedures. Currently, an international team of hair restoration doctors is perfecting this new procedure in the UK and looking to bring it to North America.

                <p className="card-text">
                Hair cloning uses approximately 50 healthy follicle cells or dermal papillae that are extracted using the FUE procedure from the subject’s areas that are not bald.  They are then Cryopreserved which is a process where biological constructs are preserved by cooling to shallow temperatures (typically -80 °C or -196 °C). They would then be shipped to a facility where they can be multiplied (cloned) and grown in a culture. These newly produced cells can be re-implanted in the areas of hair loss where they would act healthy and produce hair.

                Doctors are working diligently to make hair cloning a reality in North America. 85% of men by the age of 50 years old will have significant hair loss according to the American hair loss association. And by the time Women turn 40 years old, 40% of them will experience hair loss, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.

                It uses a cutting-edge technique where the surgeon carefully removes the donor’s hairs and then implants them into the treatment area(s) for an immediate result. There are also other options for hair restoration options such as PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) injections that use your blood platelets to stimulate growth, Minoxidil, a topical solution, Finasteride an oral regrowth medication and laser.
