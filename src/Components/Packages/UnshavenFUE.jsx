              Typically, hair loss restoration techniques require the head to be
              shaved, in order to provide access to the maximum number of hairs
              possible to harvest from the donor area. However, an innovative
              technique known as the Unshaven Hair Transplant, also referred to
              as U-FUE, offers an undetectable solution for patients who are
              unwilling to shave their hair completely for the treatment. This
              minimally-invasive and effective treatment is intricate and far
              more delicate than traditional FUE hair transplant methods,
              however our expert surgeons at HairAge have many yearsâ€™ experience
              in providing this complex method.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              One of the main difficulties with this particular method is the
              fact that the surgeon must skillfully and effectively identify the
              healthiest hairs, amongst full-grown hair, in order to harvest and
              graft the strongest follicles. This will allow the best possible
              results to be achieved for the patient.

              How Does the Unshaven Hair Transplant Procedure Work?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Similar to a traditional FUE hair transplant, each hair is
              extracted individually from a specific donor area on a strong part
              of the scalp. With U-FUE, the process is much more delicate, as
              there is much more hair to work around. Once hair is extracted,
              small strands will be cut off in order to ensure only the grafts
              are implanted.

              Which Patients Are Eligible For U-FUE?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Many patients are eligible for U-FUE transplants, but these are
              often best suited to those who require a small number of grafts in
              order to achieve the desired results. This is also suited to those
              who are uncomfortable with having a traditional FUE procedure,
              where hair will need to be shaved. Many celebrities, brand
              representatives and women opt for the U-FUE procedure, as they are
              often able to return to work without any noticeable attention from
              it.

              The Benefits of Unshaven Follicular Unit Extraction
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              One of the major benefits of the unshaven hair transplant
              procedure is the fact that the implants are arranged to match the
              natural growing characteristics of the existing hair follicles. In
              addition to this, the minimally invasive procedure is almost
              pain-free, with many patients actually falling asleep while the
              procedure is taking place. However, due to the intricacy of this
              particular treatment, it can take much longer, and is therefore
              only suitable for those seeking hair transplantations with a
              smaller number of grafts.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              At HairAge, the maximum number of grafts that we can perform with
              this treatment is 2500, with the procedure taking between 8-9
              hours. With unshaven follicular unit extraction, there is minimal
              inconvenience and patients can often return to work straight away
              as the hair does not have to be shaved. This allows for patients
              to keep their original hair, without any variances to the style
              and length, meaning they can enjoy a gradual and less noticeable
              transplant.
