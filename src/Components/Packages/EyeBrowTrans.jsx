            <p className="card-text">
              What happened to my eyebrows? Eyebrow loss can occur in both men
              and women, and is most commonly due to injury/trauma resulting in
              scars, hormone imbalance, over-plucking/over-tweezing, heredity,
              and-or aging. Eyebrow can occur slowly over time or happen
              quickly. Eyebrow pencils, ‘permanent’ makeup tattoos and
              microblading offer only two-dimensional eyebrow restoration and
              are not permanent, so many patients with thinning or lost eyebrows
              seek an eyebrow transplant.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Why Restore your eyebrows?</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Eyebrows provide the natural symmetrical aesthetic frame to the
              upper face and eye area. Eyebrows are used for communication,
              especially emotional expression. Years ago, eyebrow “trends” were
              thinner. Today, the fashion trend is thicker, fuller eyebrows. If
              you have an eyebrow scar, this can disrupt the natural aesthetic
              symmetry of the face. Eyebrow transplantation offers an adjunctive
              and permanent restoration of a living and growing eyebrow using
              comfortable, modern microsurgical techniques. For women, aesthetic
              beauty of the eye area is incomplete without eyebrows. For men,
              thick full healthy eyebrows are a masculine sign of youth and
              vitality.

              How is an eyebrow transplant performed?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Careful, meticulous artistic design of the eyebrows are critical
              to the success of the procedure. Once the design is “set,” the
              eyebrow transplant procedure may proceed.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Under comfortable local anesthesia, scalp hair follicles are moved
              one-at-a-time into the eyebrow area. It bears repeating that
              careful artistic planning and meticulous angulation of each hair
              is critical to the naturalness of the final result. After several
              days of healing and crusting, the eyebrow skin returns to normal
              and the transplanted follicles are dormant. Hair will begin to
              appear first as stubble, starting approximately 6-12 weeks later
              growing longer and denser as the weeks go by. The final ‘result’
              of an eyebrow transplant takes 8-10 months to grow in. The
              transplanted hairs will need to be routinely trimmed. Eyebrow
              transplants at HairAge are now be performed with the
              no-scalpel/no-stitch, no-linear-scar harvesting technique using
              FUE method for quicker and more comfortable recovery.

              How long does an eyebrow transplant last?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Eyebrow transplantation produces living and growing eyebrows in
              the transplanted brow area that last as long as your natural
              growing hair.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">
              How Long Does an Eyebrow Transplant Take?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              An eyebrow transplant procedure typically takes several hours to
              perform.

              What is the downtime from an Eyebrow Transplant?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Eyebrow transplants typically take about 7-10 days to completely
              heal. Scabbing and crusting in the eyebrow area flake off at that
              time and the skin returns to normal appearance. Bruising and
              swelling during that time is rare, and can take several days to
              resolve. Transplanted hair will begin to grow in the brow at 6-12
              weeks following your procedure.
