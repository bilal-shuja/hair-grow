              The crown, also known as the vertex, is an area of the scalp that
              can require hair transplantation either in isolation or in
              combination with other regions of the scalp. Crown hair transplant
              procedures are perhaps the most technically demanding of all types
              of hair restoration procedures due to the fact that extreme hair
              angle changes occur in the crown area in a whorl, or spiral,
              pattern which must be meticulously recreated for a seamlessly
              natural result. Additionally, the crown typically has extensive
              areas of baldness that require transplantation, resulting in the
              need for a large number of grafts in one area.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Crown Hair Transplant Procedure</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              There are a few basic facts about crown hair restoration that
              every individual should know before contemplating having a crown
              hair replacement procedure. These include the following:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                The crown is in a state of ongoing recession, especially in men
                experiencing male pattern baldness. This means that additional
                hair restoration sessions may be required in the future to cover
                further baldness that may occur in this area. Due to this fact,
                we generally recommend that patients under 35 years of age do
                not undergo crown hair transplantation, since the crown area
                will continue to lose hair over time and the individual may not
                have a sufficient amount of donor hair to cover the balding area
                in the future.
              </li>
              <li>
                During hair transplant, crown areas require an extensive number
                of grafts to achieve excellent results and may require two
                sessions, depending on the extent of baldness.
              </li>
              <li>
                If the front and crown areas of the head both experience
                extensive hair loss, results can appear unnatural and may lack
                density if the front, center and crown are addressed during a
                single transplant session unless a mega session (over 3,000
                grafts) is performed. You must be evaluated for your candidacy
                to have this procedure.
              </li>
              <li>
                Someone contemplating crown hair restoration is advised to be on
                medical management (finasteride and/or minoxidil) to retard
                further hair loss in the crown area in order to minimize the
                need for further transplant sessions in the future. This is
                particularly advisable for someone younger contemplating having
                a crown hair transplant.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Crown Transplant Technique</p>
            <p className="card-text">
              Achieving desired results during crown hair replacement can be
              rather tricky and requires the technical skill and artistic vision
              of a hair transplant specialist. We fully understand natural
              patterns of hair loss in men, a key element in re-creating hair
              growth in the crown that looks natural and can be maintained over
              time. This creates the most effective two-dimensional and
              three-dimensional results, and provides hair restoration results
              that will age well over time.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Crown hair transplant procedures may differ in how hair follicles
              are extracted from the donor site, and can be done using the FUE
              method or traditional linear harvesting. No matter the harvesting
              method, grafts are meticulously prepared for implantation by
              HairAge experienced team and are expertly placed to achieve
              perfect angles, direction, pattern and graft-to-site fit.One of
              the keys to HairAge exceptional hair transplant crown results is
              the fact that he is involved in every step of the process and does
              not hand-off any part of the procedure to a rotating team, as is
              common in other hair restoration practices.

              Cost of Crown Hair Transplantation
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Crown hair transplant cost can vary greatly from patient to
              patient, based primarily on the area of hair loss to be covered
              and the hair density needed to achieve natural results. These
              factors will affect the number of grafts required during crown
              transplant surgery, and may even dictate that more than one
              procedure be performed. Due to the individualized nature of crown
              hair transplantation costs, details will be discussed with you
              during your initial consultation at HairAge.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Causes of Crown Hair Loss</p>
            <p className="card-text">
              Many men experience hair loss in the crown area due to traditional
              male pattern baldness. Women can also experience hair loss in the
              crown area as the result of a number of conditions, although hair
              loss is typically more dispersed than the concentrated balding
              pattern seen in men. Some conditions that may result in hair loss
              in the crown area include alopecia areata, anagen hair loss,
              cicatricial alopecias, disorders of hair growth, inflammatory
              scalp, telogen hair loss, tinea capitis, traction alopecia and
              trichotillomania.

              Determining whether hair restoration surgery is the best option to
              treat hair loss in the crown area must carefully be considered
              based on a number of factors, including the extent of hair loss,
              the likelihood of future hair loss (and the possibility of having
              enough donor hair over time to replace new balding areas), and the
              ability to create natural-looking hair patterns in the crown area
              using hair transplantation. We will advise you on the best crown
              hair restoration options for you during your initial consultation.

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Crown Hair Transplant Recovery</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Crown hair transplant recovery is generally similar to recovery
              from other types of hair transplant surgery. Recovery is dependent
              partially on the method of donor hair harvesting (linear
              harvesting or follicular unit extraction) as well as the size of
              the coverage area and number of grafts required. However, it
              typically only takes less than 24 hours to recover from hair
              transplant surgery. By the day after your surgery, you should be
              able to resume most daily activities, although it is recommended
              that you hold off on strenuous activities for a week to prevent
              any accidental injury and reduce the risk of bleeding. You can
              return to work on the day following surgery, although many people
              choose to take a few days off following the procedure. Otherwise,
              you can expect to have some tiny scabbing in the transplanted area
              for up to a week, will have no bandages, and can wash your hair on
              the day following surgery. You can wear a hat or cap immediately
              after surgery if you wish to conceal any scabs.
