              The two most common solutions are advanced surgical scar revision
              techniques like a so-called geometric broken line repair and a
              hair-transplant technique to implant hairs into a scar. Although
              the geometric broken line technique is a successful method of scar
              repair in hands of a skillful plastic surgeon, not every patient
              is a candidate for this procedure. Sometimes, excising an old scar
              may cause another sometimes even wider scar. Consequently, in
              specific situations transplanting hairs into a scar may be the
              best solution to scar repair.

            <p className="card-text">
              A common reason for hair transplant would be the loss of the
              sideburn, temple, and behind the ear in traditional facelift
              surgery that robs a woman (and man) of these vital hairs that
              contribute to both naturalness and youth. Another reason would be
              due to prior scalp surgeries like skin cancer surgeries of the
              scalp or brow lifting or brain surgery that lead to scalp hair
              loss. Hair loss from scars can occur anywhere there is hair, like
              in the eyebrows, beard, chest, pubis, etc. Of course, hair loss
              can occur in the back of the head from prior hair-transplant
              surgery.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              There are various methods of harvesting hairs in order to
              undertake scar repair, such as FU-strip, FUE or body hair
              transplant. In addition, medical tattooing is a non-surgical
              technique that can help camouflage scars and make them blend
              better with surrounding hairs. Considering that there are many
              ways to repair scars, during the consultation, At HairAge, we
              discuss with you the method or combination of methods that would
              best suit your specific situation. for example, with a prior hair
              transplant scar in the back of the head, if the person is prone to
              scarring in this area, then an FUE method may be ideal to avoid
              further scarring. If there is no more hair left, then hair maybe
              taken from the beard area.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Scalp micropigmentation (SMP):</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              can be combined with any method to further improve the result. For
              facelift scars, oftentimes the traditional FU-strip method may be
              preferred for the following reasons: 1) could be combined with a
              larger concurrent hair transplant 2) provides better quality
              grafts 3) avoids the need for any preparatory scalp shaving. If
              the scar is contracted, thickened, or misaligned, a formal scar
              revision involving the excision of skin and repair may be an
              important initial step before hair transplant into the scar can be
              undertaken.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              We are skilled at both the surgical scar revision as well as the
              subsequent hair transplant. However, it is worth stating here that
              scalp hair loss typically is not very amenable to excisional
              methods of repair, i.e., cutting out the scar and closing it
              oftentimes leads to the same recurrence of the previous scar.
              Scalp scars are truly unique entities and cannot be compared with
              facial scars. Usually, the prior scar arose from either poor
              surgical technique or the anatomical predisposition of the patient
              to form scars.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Either way, the blood supply to the area is already typically
              compromised to the point that simply excising the scar will cause
              a recurrence. Interestingly, more elaborate scar repair techniques
              used on the face are ill advised in the scalp because they
              actually cause the scar to worsen. We have observed many patients
              who have sought a facial plastic surgeon or plastic surgeon to
              repair a scalp scar only to find that the scar either did not
              change or instead worsened. Accordingly, hair transplant into the
              scar and/or SMP are the preferred methods of treatment.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">
              When transplanting into scars, we employ a specialized method for
              transplantation using micro punching to attain a better outcome.
              These tiny punches remove a small core of the scar with each punch
              so as to achieve the following objectives:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Physical reduction of the bald scar.</li>
              <li>
                Replacement of unhealthy scar tissue with healthy hair graft
                tissue.
              </li>
              <li>
                Better access and contact with the underlying healthy blood
                supply to improve graft growth.
              </li>
              <li>Physical relaxation of the scar tissue.</li>
            </ul>

            <p className="card-text">
              We also believe that the use of bio-enhancement technology like
              PRP and liposomal ATP are critical in scar repairs to enhance
              graft survival in areas of otherwise diminished blood supply. He
              uses these adjunctive measures in all surgical hair transplant
              cases.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              As mentioned, FUE is a viable alternative method in many cases
              (and at times the preferred method) to improve scars. When
              transplanting into the scars in the back of the head when the
              tissue has multiple scars that are further inelastic and tight,
              FUE is the only acceptable method for hair transplantation.
              Oftentimes, in these cases, beard hair is the preferred source of
              donor hair for the following reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                No scalp shaving is needed (which would expose the scars during
                the recovery phase)
              </li>
              <li>The donor hair may already be depleted.</li>
              <li>The donor hair caliber is thin, weak, or unsuitable.</li>
              <li>
                The beard area supplies typically an abundant, thick, and
                fast-growing donor hair and heals quickly and imperceptibly in
                most cases. In rare cases, chest hair may be needed to
                supplement or be used as an alternative to beard hair but this
                is less than ideal to the thinner caliber and slower growth
                pattern of chest hair.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h5 className="font-weight-bold">
            In many cases, the ideal solution for a scar is to use multiple methods to achieve the best result.
            </h5>

            <p className="card-text">
                <b>For example:</b>
                <p className="card-text">
                f the patient undergoes an FUE procedure to repair a scar but has a few areas within the scar that are evident, then SMP is an easy method to further treat the scar. In select cases, some patients may elect only to undergo SMP and forgo surgery. Oftentimes, the best results can be achieved by starting with either FUE or strip hair transplant into a scar followed by SMP.
                </p>

                <p className="card-text">
                The combined method can look better in more circumstances, as when the hair is wet or cut shorter. A consultation at HairAge can help you decide which method or methods are better for you based on your particular anatomy, type and location of scar, cause of scar, budget, and recovery time, to list only a few of the many variables that guide therapy.
