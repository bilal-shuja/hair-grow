              Beards have been a huge trend in the last few years, and the trend
              seems to have stayed strong. We’ve had an increase in the number
              of enquiries regarding our beard transplant procedure and how
              exactly it works. Today we’re going to tell you exactly what a
              beard transplant is and how it works.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">How do beard transplants work?</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              If you’re familiar with our FUE hair transplant procedure you will
              more than likely understand what a beard transplant is, and how
              they work.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              At the HairAge Clinic, we use the Micro-FUE for our hair
              transplants, and the same procedure is used for beard transplants.
              This results in the most natural and realistic result possible.
              During a hair transplant hair follicles are transplanted from one
              area of the head to another. Our beard transplants differ
              slightly.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              The hair is found on the scalp and then transplanted to the beard
              area. Individual hair follicles are removed from the scalp with a
              specialist extraction tool, which leaves minimal scarring, these
              follicles are then prepared under a microscope and ready to be
              transplanted. One of our specialist doctors will transplant the
              hair follicles to areas of the beard that have noticeable scars,
              gaps, or areas of the face the patient wants us to build upon.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Our doctors have great experience with creating the most natural
              looking transplant possible and they are trained to place the hair
              follicles in the recipient area at an angle and density to match
              the natural hair growth pattern, resulting in a natural looking
              transplant.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">Who is a suitable candidate?</p>

            <p className="card-text">
              We often get clients who have very little facial hair coming into
              the clinic wanting to leave with a much fuller and thicker beard.
              Sometimes transformations like these are not as easy to achieve as
              you may wish.
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              We believe the beard transplant procedure is perfect for those who
              have patchy beards. A lot of people will find certain areas of
              their beard will constantly have bald patches where the hair
              doesn’t grow, our treatment can work to fill those patches in. It
              also works great for anyone who has any facial scarring and has
              found that the hair will not grow.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">
              Will a beard transplant be permanent?
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Similar to hair transplants a beard transplant is the most
              permanent hair restoration treatment. We take the hair follicles
              from an area of the scalp where the hair is unlikely to fall out
              as you age, and this means once transplanted the hair should
              continue to grow for a number of years. However, as you age there
              is a chance your remaining facial hair could begin to change
              slightly. This is something we take into account and is something
              always discuss as part of our consultation process.
