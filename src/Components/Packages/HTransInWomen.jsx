              If you are having hair fall, don’t delay a visit to a hair loss
              specialist. There is a hair loss treatment for women in most
              situations, but an adequate diagnosis must be made first. Without
              treatment, hair loss tends to progress and worsen over time.
              Unlike men, female pattern hair loss may affect the entire scalp,
              but women generally do not become completely bald.

            <p className="card-text">
              The Ludwig Classification describes stages of the progression of
              untreated female pattern hair loss. The further along you are in
              the classification, the more hair has been damaged and lost
              forever. Time is not on your side if you are experiencing hair
              loss because you cannot regrow lost hair. You must seek treatment
              as soon as you notice hair loss or thinning to maintain the hair
              you do have.

              Finding the Most Effective Hair Restoration Method for Women
            </p>

            <p className="card-text">
              Although not every woman with hair loss is a candidate for hair
              transplantation, all may be helped by a combination of medical
              treatments. These include Rogaine (Minoxidil), Viviscal®, the
              Capillus RX 312 Laser Therapy Device and other prescription
              medications, depending on your condition. In some cases,
              relatively simple treatments can produce dramatic results. Another
              available treatment is the new and effective PRP/Stem Cells
              procedure that is offered at HairAge. A simple, office procedure
              that utilizes you own stem cells and platelets to help your hair
              get stronger, fuller and thicker.
