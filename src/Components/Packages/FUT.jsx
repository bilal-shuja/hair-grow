              Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) or Strip Harvesting
            </p>
            <p className="card-text">
              Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT Hair Transplants), or strip
              harvesting, is the most popular hair transplant procedure at
              HairAge Clinic. FUT allows the surgeon to safely transplant
              thousands of grafts in a single session, which maximizes the
              cosmetic impact of the procedure. During the hair transplant, a
              strip of hair is taken from either the sides or back of the scalp,
              and transplanted to the affected area.

            <p className="fon-weight-bold">Why have an FUT hair transplant?</p>
            <p className="card-text">
              A third of men are losing their hair by the time they are 30; 40%
              are losing it by the time they are 40 and more than half of men
              over 50 are showing signs of baldness. Nine out of ten patients at
              HairAge Clinic are men seeking a permanent remedy to their
              baldness. Around 10% of our patients are women who have
              experienced problems with thinning hair, and half of women will
              experience some kind of hair loss in their lives. With hair loss
              an issue for both genders, both men and women can benefit from an
              FUT procedure.
            </p>

            <p className="font-weight-bold">
              We treat hair transplant patients for the following reasons:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                By far the most popular reason is cosmetic: men find that hair
                loss can damage their self-esteem and even their career
                prospects. Hair transplantation is a permanent solution to this
                problem. The transplanted hair is permanent and will last the
                patient for the rest of his or her life.
              </li>
              <li>
                Virtually all men, even those in the advanced stages of
                baldness, have a permanent horse-shoe of hair on the back and
                sides of the scalp. This gives the surgeon a stable supply of
                donor hair which can cover current and future areas of hair
                loss.
              </li>
              <li>
                We tend to operate on patients aged 25 and over – by this age,
                we are able to establish what the eventual pattern of hair loss
                might be. Prior to 25, the pattern is not established and it is
                not in the patient’s best interests to operate.
              </li>
              <li>
                Physical trauma-facial injury and scarring resulting from events
                such as road accidents, industrial accidents, thermal and
                chemical burns.
              </li>
              <li>
                Medical and surgical treatments. Surgical treatment of injury or
                tumor that results in removal of hair and tissue scarring;
                radiotherapy or chemotherapy for cancer that results in loss of
                hair.
              </li>

            <p className="card-text">
              Within 30 minutes of the hair transplant ending, you are able to
              go home, though we recommend that you do not drive. With modern
              hair transplantation techniques used at HairAge Clinic, we can
              produce results that are virtually undetectable – even under the
              closest scrutiny.

              An FUT hair transplant will leave a scar on the scalp but this is
              generally not be detectable beneath the hair of patients, unless
              they shave their head around the scar tissue new hair growth will
              start to grow back around three or four months after the
              procedure. However, it will take at least six to eight months for
              the new hair to make any significant cosmetic difference to your
              appearance.
