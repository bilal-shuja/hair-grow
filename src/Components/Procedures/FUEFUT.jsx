   Why opt for Automated FUE vs FUT Hair Restoration?
   </p>
    
    <p className="card-text">
    The automated Follicular Unit Extraction (FUE) process can be performed with less downtime than other hair restoration methods, and without leaving a visible linear scar line. Compared to the FUT or strip method, FUE is less invasive. The strip method involves removing an actual strip of scalp from the patient’s head. The hair restoration surgeon then divides the strip of scalp into individual sections also known as grafts. Each graft or follicular unit is made up of an individual hair or several hairs. These grafts are then surgically placed in the areas of the patient’s scalp that are affected by hair loss or balding.
    </p>

    <p className="card-text">
    The strip method (also sometimes referred to as the HairAge strip method) has one major drawback: The resulting linear scar from where the strip of hair is removed. While it can eventually be disguised with longer hair, it is visible on men with short hair. Men who like to wear their hair short prefer the FUE method. Professional athletes who cannot afford a long break from strenuous activity also prefer the FUE method since it virtually has no downtime other than the day of the actual procedure.
    </p>


    <p className="card-text">
    When you evaluate FUE vs FUT, HairAge FUE method comes out ahead. The HairAge hair transplant technician uses an automated tool that can harvest a large number of hair grafts at one time.  It uses pneumatic pressure to extract follicles of hair from the donor area and then reinserts them in the recipient area via small pinpricks.
