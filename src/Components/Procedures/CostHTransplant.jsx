          Hair Transplant Costs

          <p className="card-text">
          The cost of hair transplantation can vary significantly from one clinic to another. The primary factor on cost depends on the technique that you choose. For example, FUE hair transplants are usually more expensive than traditional STRIP technique because it is more time consuming and technically demanding. In some instances, FUE can be twice as expensive than STRIP.

          <p className="card-text">
          Price is also determined by the total number of grafts you need. It is common practice to reduce the surgical fee if you proceed with a larger procedure. Last but not least, hair transplant cost is largely dependent on the doctor. The price differential can be as much as 50% or more depending on the surgeon you choose. When it comes to making a hair transplant decision, we encourage patients to make your decision not based on the price alone. Go with a surgeon who produces consistent results over an extended period of time.

          Automated FUE reduces the costs of hair transplantation and increases the total number of grafts transplanted in a single session. The final result of hair transplantation surgery varies from patient to patient, but the majority of our patients are very satisfied with the procedure performed in our office.
