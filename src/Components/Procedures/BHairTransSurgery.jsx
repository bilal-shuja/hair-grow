    <h2> Before Hair Transplant Surgery</h2>

      <p className="card-text">
      The following instructions should be carefully followed before a hair transplant or scalp procedure. If you are unclear about any of the instructions, please contact our office. This procedure will take a full day. Please plan on being here all day.
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
      The length of the procedure is determined by the amount of grafts, how well the procedure is going, blood pressure, if there is unusual bleeding or graft popping, etc. This is why it is important to follow pre-op instructions.
      </p>

      <p className="font-weight-bold">
      TWO WEEKS BEFORE PROCEDURE:
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
      Stop taking any medications or vitamin supplements that contain aspirin, ibuprofen.
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
            Herbs (Echinacea, Gingko Biloba, Garlic) or Vitamin E for 2 weeks before the procedure. These medications increase your risk for bleeding making it very difficult for your newly transplanted grafts “to take.” Bleeding during the procedure also adds hours to the amount of time necessary to complete the procedure. Be sure to check with a pharmacist before using any over the counter medications.
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
        Pain, cold, flu, and allergy medications often contain aspirin or ibuprofen. Panadol is OK Start taking1000mg of Vitamin C three times per day as this helps with healing. If you are having FUT, do not cut the hair on the back of your head before surgery. This will make it more difficult to hide the suture line. Keep it around 1-2 inches long for best results, Stop Hair Medical Home Infusion Hair Restore System®.
      </p>

      <p className="font-weight-bold">
      ONE WEEK BEFORE PROCEDURE:
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
      Refrain from alcohol one full week before and after the procedure. Alcohol makes you more likely to bleed during a surgical procedure. Refrain from smoking and nicotine products one week before your procedure. Nicotine constricts blood vessels making it difficult for oxygen rich blood to get to the surgical site. You will either come in to see or receive a telephone call from the RN or NP. She will review your health history with you as well as your instructions and answer any questions you may have. If you have ever experienced high blood pressure, asthma, chest pains or palpitations, liver or kidney problems, sleep disorders, or shortness of breath, it is extremely important that we have this information. Stop using Rogaine products please refrain from any form of casual exercise 3-7 days prior to surgery If you weight train, body build or do strenuous cardio exercise, please refrain from this type of activity for at least 1 week prior to surgery. If you take any type of supplements for weight training/body building, please refrain from taking these products for one week.
      </p>

      <p className="font-weight-bold">
      NIGHT BEFORE YOUR PROCEDURE:
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
      Wash your hair mild shampoo, leave in place for one minute and rinse out. Do not wash your hair or apply hair products the day of the procedure. Be sure you have picked up all of your prescription medications and arranged for transportation to and from The Transplant clinic for your procedure. You will receive a phone call from the hair team the day before your surgery to confirm your arrival time for your surgery, at which time you will receive instructions regarding any restrictions on eating or drinking the night before your surgery.

      <p className="font-weight-bold">
      ON THE DAY OF YOUR PROCEDURE:
      </p>

      <p className="card-text">
      We will provide you with lunch so let us know any food allergies or restrictions. You will receive a phone call the day before your procedure confirming arrival time. You will be given light sedation during the procedure. Due to the length of the procedure, light sedation will allow you to relax helping to pass the time quickly. You will need to have someone drive you home.

      <p className="card-text">
      Wear comfortable clothing that does not need to be pulled over your head. A button down or zippered shirt is easiest and some patients like to wear sweatpants for comfort. Valuables should be left at home. Cell phones need to remain off during procedure. Please do not bring reading material or computers with you since you will be in a reclining position for the majority of the day and unable to use them. We provide cable TV and have some movies available for your entertainment.
