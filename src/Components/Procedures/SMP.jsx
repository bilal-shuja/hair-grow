        <h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
        <p className="card-text">
        We apply pigments at the dermal level of your scalp – creating the appearance of greater hair density. SMP can be used anywhere hair is thinning: the frontal and temple hairlines, the crown, bald spots, patches, or even scars left from the Follicular Unit Transplantation (FUT) surgery. SMP is ideal for men and women in early stages of thinning to advances hair loss.
